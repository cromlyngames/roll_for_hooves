# Roll_for_capes
a specific game based on the *roll for shoes engine* by Ben Wray, with the setting based on the Parahumans web serial by Wildbow.
In this game you play as 'capes' - superheros with super powers in a 4 tone comic book world with plenty of black ink.

# Character Creation

Tell us a little about your character. Are they an adult or are they at school? Before their trigger, what did they want to do as a job? What was their secret dream they never admitted to anyone?

Now roll two six sided dice to see what type of trigger they had on the table below. You can use either dice for the type and time frame of the stress. Example. Rolling a 1 and a 4 give you the option of a Sudden Spiritual trigger leading to a Sranger type power, OR a Rapid, Physical trigger leading to Mover powers.
If you don't like either choice roll a *complication* and reroll your power. If you still don't like it, roll a *side-effect* as well and reroll your power. You must stick with this final roll. Th

Tell us about the trigger. Just like dreams, the power reflects what is in your character's head at the time. Give the power a little bit more of a specialisim based on the situation or your character's history, eg Acid, Petals, Carpet, Noise, Optimisim. That is your Level 1 power.

Finally, without showing anyone else, write down how you'd like your character to die, ( fighting Godzilla, saving a burning bus full of kids, plunging over a waterfall wrestling your nemesis) on a piece of paper and pass it to the DM. They are not going to try to make it come true, but they might allow a similar situation to come up during the game.

Weaverdice goes into a lot more detail on the type of triggers and the combinations or specialisims of powers that are likely produced. This is just my approximation.

## Complications
 Roll 2d6 | Complication | examples
---|---|---
2| Stalker | Another cape thematically opposed who is truly, madly obessed with you. They will always come after you and will never give up.
3| Wanted | You are wanted by the police. It is serious. What did you do?
4| Sponsor | you have a sponsor who pays for your nice costume and equipment. Sometimes they need you to help them with adverts, PR or worse.
5| Dependents | you have someone, a granmother, lil brother or a child dependent on you.
6| Health | Your power is driving you mad or killing you through damage, insomnia, addiction or mutation. Can you survive long enough to make a difference?
7| Flashbacks | The DM will sometimes drop these on you. Try not to kill anyone during it. 
8| Self Defense | You have trained in martial arts/shooting/boxing/parkour or something similar, in addition to your power.
9| Legacy | You are not the first with this power/costume. You have a legacy to maintain (and inherited enemies, perhaps)
10| Mouth | You simply cannot resist chances to gloat, pun or monolouge, even when you should really be running
11| Pro | You have professional skills (accoutnant, engineer, lawyer). Sometimes that skill is needed, not your power.
12| Faith | You have a strong faith, and some strong taboos. Describe them and how they've changed your life.


## Side Effects
 Roll | Side Effect | examples
---|---|---
2| Sense Rewired | Choose a sense (includinng odd ones like balance or direction). It now operates through your power. How does that effect what the DM tells you about the world?
3| Incontinence | You can't turn your power off or it triggers randomly sometimes.
4| Unreliable | Your power waxes and wanes based on some rule that you don't understand
5| Inhuman | You have been physcially mutated by your power trigger. You cannot pass as a human civilian.
6| Dietry requirement | You can only eat something rare, expensive or dangerous to those around you. What is it?
7| Flashbacks | The DM will sometimes drop these on you. Try not to kill anyone during it. 
8| Asbestos pants | Your power requires specialist/expensive/rare materials to survive

## Rules

The core rules are short and simple enough.

1) Say what you do (with your power) and roll a number of d6s.

2) If the sum of your roll is higher than the opposing roll (either another player or the GM), the thing you wanted to happen, happens.

3) The number of the d6s you roll is determined by the level of skill you have.

4) At start, you have only one skill: *Use Power 1*.

5) If you roll all sixes on your roll, you can get new skill one level higher than the one you used for the action. The skill must make sense for what you said you were doing. 

6) For every roll you fail, you get 1 XP.

7) XP can be used to change a die into a 6 for advancement purposes but not for success purposes.

8) Ties: On a tie, the GM will offer the player a hard bargain. You still succeed, but at a cost. There is no XP.

9) Damage: There are no health points. You are super heros. You're either immune or it wipes you out. Damage happens in the story, is often thematic and can be used by a canny player to drive new skills.



Expanded rule examples:
1) *Say what you do and roll a number of d6s.* - this is simple but important. Don't roll a skill and then try and figure out what you did. Say what you are doing and figure out if you have a skill for it yet. If not, you might get lucky on your roll!

2) *If the sum of your roll is higher than the opposing roll (either another player or the DM), the thing you wanted to happen, happens.* - Two details here. One is that rolls are always opposed, even if it's just the GM rolling one dice to represent your contorl of your power, luck or reality. The other is that *the thing you want to happen, happens*. The GM is allowed to negotiate with you before the roll, but fundamentally, their job is to allow you to get into trouble by saying yes.

3) *The number of the dice you roll is determined by the level of skill you have.*
So for *Use Power 1* you roll one dice. For *Gelatinous body 2* roll two dice. There's no upper limit on high a skill level can be, but the higher the skill the more specialist it will be. Enjoy the success when it comes up, you've earned it!

4) *At start, you have only one skill: *Use Power 1*.*
The broad power type will be decided by your trigger at character creation (eg Blaster, Mover, Changer). You were a functioning human before, and you retain that. Opening doors, driving cars ect should not be a problem. BUT the only way you can force changes in the fiction is through power use. You can role play a conversation and the DM decides the outcome. You can suggest you are using your Blaster Power to Intimidate instead, and then you get to roll. Power use can be direct, indirect or weirdly abstract. Want to *Noise Blast* through the door? Roll. Want to create a *subsonic hum* to make other people feel paranoid? Roll. Want to use your *Noise Blaster mindset* to assess the Shock and Awe part of a mayoral election campaign? Roll. 
Want to *blast* another player out of the sky? Both of you roll. 

5) *If you roll all sixes on your roll, you can get new skill one level higher than the one you used for the action. The skill must make sense for what you said you were doing. *
Say, *Clinging tendrils 2* if you were climbing a wall, or *Telekinesis 2* if you were trying to turn a door knob you couldn't reach. For higher skills, the subset means it is stronger but more focused than the skill it came from. If you rolled two sixes when using *Clinging tendrils 2* to hang onto a fast moving car, it'd make sense to add *Barbed griphooks 3* or *Grip of terror 3*. The setting uses new superheross because it makes sense for them to develop their powers and gain new skills over the course of the game. 

6) *For every roll you fail, you get 1 XP.*
In the case of player versus player, this means the loser gets XP. The GM doesn't get to collect XP, they've already got massive world creating powers. 

7) *XP can be used to change a die into a 6 for advancement purposes but not for success purposes.*
If you try to do something and fail, you can spend the XP you just got to advance that skill, but you have to let the other players take a turn in the spotlight before you try that same thing again. Poker chips are great for tracking XP. 

8) *Ties: On a tie, the GM will offer the player a hard bargain. You still succeed, but at a cost. There is no XP*
For the GM, these are the results that allow you to give the player what they wanted to happen, AND to introduce a new round of complications to drive the story forward. Sometimes the tied result is obvious and feels natural - like two different heros sharing the glory for stopping a bank raid. Other times it need the GM to think a little, or just give them what they want and introduce a completely new complication. 
Example of new problem: "You shape shift into the shape of the stunned goon before the others come back out of the vault, but you hear a police car pull up outside. There's knocking on the door..."
Example of moving the player character: "Your forcefield comes up and blocks the incoming giant hammer, but you feel the ground starting to give way beneath you. You can escape the Ice Giant, but only by going down into the sewer. What do you do?"

9) *Damage: There are no health points. You are super heros. You're either immune or it wipes you out.*
This is the real test for the GM. Thinking about damage and adapting to changes to their character take time and mental effort for players. It's why players will often ask if they 'loose a dice' or similar for damage. Although mechanically it makes the game more complicated, it's easier to think about it. Purely narrative described damage is something people are actually quite adverse to and will make effort in the story to avoid.  Intrusion into player self image smarts in the way that crossing off a health box doesn't even if the GM has to think a little more.
The same applies to death. Although making a new character takes seconds, if you allow death you can get player vs player descending into a huge and powerful Supervillan player chasing down and killing a weak newly triggered player again and again. While a great image and fun game if the player of the weak character(s) actively volunteers for it, it could be a boring and frustrating session for that player if they feel trapped into it by the table's social contract. 

## Principle Rules for the GM

Be a fan of the characters.


Help the players get into interesting situations


Make the world seem real.


When in doubt:
nudge them to use their powers
*make them feel small at the start*
separate them 
*push them together*
ask a loaded question
*tell them something their character has only just noticed*
tell the consequences and ask
*give them something to fight for*
give them something to fight over
*take away their stuff*
introduce a complication
*introduce active opposition*


a) *When the GM rolls for generic reality to oppose a player, roll a single dice.*
If this seems low and too easy for players to beat, don't worry. The more confident they are about rolling, the more they will do and the more trouble they'll get into. You'll get your opportunities. Every success they have should change the situation significantly. This is not a game for grinding down hit points. One good hit is all they should need. Two if you want to make a point of how tough this opposition is.

b) *If reality rolls a six, reality gets a new skill.*
The GM doesn't collect XP, but you can upgrade reality by rolling sixes same as other players. It also means that the reality 'stiffens' against precisely the things your players are doing (and getting better at). The more players there are, the faster this will happen, and player's will find they need to focus on a niche. This won't happen as fast with only one or two players, which is good as they'll have more to do. I like manifesting high level reality skills (3 dice or more) as other capes, voices over the radio, someone from their secret identity or similar. 

c) *It is better to roll against players than create Active opposition* 
The game comes from the players doing things. Remember that! 
However, I use the principle of introducing a 2 Dice level supervillan into the scene every time someone rolls a pair of ones. There are also times when active opposition just makes sense for the story the players have made. If you have stopped a mafia shipment of drugs worth a few million, the mafia are going to put a price on your head.

d) *The players are weird, not the world.*
The players are developing as heros because that reflects the nature of the rules. Don't give them more to process. Keep the world real and modern and based in an example city to save you having to make a map. Answer questions. Remind them they may have extra senses.

e) *Add detail, be gruesome*
The players will be reflecting your descriptions when they describe their actions. Go full silly cinematic on them. Seek to entertain, not shock.

f) *Have and use the x-card*
Read this to your players: By the nature of the game, players will probably do or witness some pretty horrible things in the fiction. Sooner or later you might hit a topic the pulls someone out of the game.
 Don't sweat it, don't ask about it. If they reach out, touch the X-Card, retcon that shit out of the fiction on the spot. Sex attacks is a common reason to use the card, but so can phobias or things like dead babies. You aren't edgelords, and you are all here to have fun. If someone asks for a topic to be avoided, avoid it. Don't circle it, refer to it or sidle up to it to provoke a reaction. Just drop it.
As GM, use the X-card yourself, on yourself, early on, to make it seem possible to use it.
